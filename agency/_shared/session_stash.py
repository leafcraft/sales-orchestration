"""Per-session scratch state for the sales mesh's bounded back-edges.

Used for the cycles that MUST terminate (Rule 3 — bound every retry
back-edge), counted across a lead's life in the mesh:

  * research → qualification → research ping-pong (a competitor lead
    that keeps re-triggering intel) → escalate / stop at the cap
  * any repeated re-qualification of the same lead in one session

In-process dict keyed by session_id. Single-replica dev default. For a
multi-replica deployment, swap the primitives below for Redis hashes
(the SDK's Redis client is available on the mesh instance).
